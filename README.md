## About Pattern Lab
- [Pattern Lab Website](http://patternlab.io/)

The PHP version of Pattern Lab is, at its core, a static site generator. It combines platform-agnostic assets, like the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)-based patterns and the JavaScript-based viewer, with a PHP-based "builder" that transforms and dynamically builds the Pattern Lab site. By making it a static site generator, Pattern Lab strongly separates patterns, data, and presentation from build logic. Pattern Lab was created by Brad Frost (http://bradfrost.com) and Dave Olsen (http://www.dmolsen.com/) with help from a vibrant group of supporters.
